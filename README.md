# Anki-Generator
Hobby project/personal productivity project
This is a text parser that reformats various text files into files that can be imported as flashcards to the spaced repitition app Anki. 
I originally created to make anki cards from kindle highlights but has since been expanded to parse other text as well, both to create anki cards, but also to sort files according to tags. 

The original project was just for my personal use so the code standard is really poor. I'm currently working on refactoring the code for increased clarity and to follow coding standards.

How to use: 
unfactored version:
go to fileArchive and run AnkiGeneratorCopy.py in your terminal
This will give you a simple terminal UI that lets you run the program in different modes depending on what settings you want to run the program in. 
For a simple demonstration you can run in quick mode by clicking 2 and enter
The program then creates files for each of the tags in the input.txt and prints info about how many cards it created
Several of the text files generated by this can now be imported with Anki's "Import file" function, while the others such as "backToDynalist.txt" are just sorted according to the tag they have.
